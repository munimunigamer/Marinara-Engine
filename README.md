## Installation

### Windows Easiest Method

Download **[Marinara-Engine-Installer-1.5.3.exe](https://github.com/Pasta-Devs/Marinara-Engine/releases/download/v1.5.3/Marinara-Engine-Installer-1.5.3.exe)** from the [Releases](https://github.com/Pasta-Devs/Marinara-Engine/releases) page and run it. The installer lets you choose the install folder, checks for Node.js and Git, aligns pnpm to the repo-pinned version even if an older global pnpm is already installed, clones the repo, installs dependencies, builds the app, and creates desktop and Start Menu shortcuts with the Marinara icon.

### Run from Source (All Platforms)

#### Prerequisites

You need **Node.js** and **Git** installed before running Marinara Engine. pnpm is handled automatically by the shell launchers, which align to the repo-pinned version even if a different global pnpm is already installed, or you can install it yourself for manual setup.

**Install Node.js v20+:**

| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows               | Download the installer from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and run it             |
| macOS                 | `brew install node` or download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download)               |
| Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) | `curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x \| sudo bash - && sudo apt install -y nodejs` |
| Linux (Fedora)        | `sudo dnf install -y nodejs`                                                                    |
| Linux (Arch)          | `sudo pacman -S nodejs npm`                                                                     |

**Install Git:**

| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows               | Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and run the installer |
| macOS                 | `brew install git` or install Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`    |
| Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) | `sudo apt install -y git`                                                           |
| Linux (Fedora)        | `sudo dnf install -y git`                                                           |
| Linux (Arch)          | `sudo pacman -S git`                                                                |

Verify both are installed:

```bash
node -v        # should show v20 or higher
git --version  # should show git version 2.x+
```

#### Quick Start

**Windows:**

```bat
git clone https://github.com/Pasta-Devs/Marinara-Engine.git
cd marinara-engine
start.bat
```

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pasta-Devs/Marinara-Engine.git
cd marinara-engine
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

**Android (Termux):**

Install [Termux](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/) from F-Droid (the Play Store version is outdated), then run:

```bash
pkg update && pkg install -y git nodejs-lts && git clone https://github.com/Pasta-Devs/Marinara-Engine.git && cd marinara-engine && chmod +x start-termux.sh && ./start-termux.sh
```

The Termux launcher downloads the prebuilt SQLite native module when available, installs dependencies, builds the app, and starts the server at `http://127.0.0.1:<PORT>` using the resolved `PORT` value from `.env` or the default `7860`. First run takes a few minutes on mobile. After that, run `./start-termux.sh` to start again.

If you also want a dedicated Android app shell, see [android/README.md](android/README.md). The APK is a WebView wrapper around the Termux-served app; it does not replace the server.

> **Tip:** Install the PWA from your browser's "Add to Home Screen" prompt for a more native feel.

When started from a git checkout, the shell launchers will:

1. **Auto-update** from Git if a `.git` folder is detected
2. Check that Node.js and the repo-pinned pnpm version are installed
3. Install all dependencies on first run
4. Build the application
5. Ensure the database schema is up to date
6. Load `.env`, resolve the final local URL, start the server, and open `http://127.0.0.1:<PORT>` in your browser by default

Set `AUTO_OPEN_BROWSER=false` in `.env` to skip the automatic browser launch. This applies to the shell launchers (`start.bat`, `start.sh`, and `start-termux.sh`) only. The Android wrapper uses its own WebView.

Set `AUTO_CREATE_DEFAULT_CONNECTION=false` in `.env` to prevent Marinara from creating the built-in OpenRouter Free starter connection on startup. By default, it is only created when the database has no saved connections.

#### Manual Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pasta-Devs/Marinara-Engine.git
cd marinara-engine
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm db:push
pnpm start
```

Then open **<http://127.0.0.1:7860>**. Everything runs locally.

Bare `pnpm start` binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. If you want LAN access without using a launcher, set `HOST=0.0.0.0` first.

### Run via Container (Docker / Podman)

#### Pre-built Image (Docker)

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Then open **<http://127.0.0.1:7860>**.

Data (SQLite database, uploads, fonts, default backgrounds) is stored in the named volume `marinara-data`. To inspect it:

```bash
docker volume inspect marinara-data
```

If you do not want the built-in OpenRouter Free starter connection to be created for new container data volumes, set `AUTO_CREATE_DEFAULT_CONNECTION=false` in your `.env` before running `docker compose up -d`.

To pull the latest image and restart:

```bash
docker compose down && docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

#### Build from Source (Docker)

If you prefer to build the image yourself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pasta-Devs/Marinara-Engine.git
cd Marinara-Engine
docker build -t marinara-engine .
docker run -d -p 7860:7860 -v marinara-data:/app/data marinara-engine
```

#### Podman

Podman is a drop-in replacement for Docker with better security features. Rootless mode is supported out of the box — no daemon required.

**Pre-built image:**

```bash
podman compose up -d
```

Or:

```bash
podman run -d -p 7860:7860 -v marinara-data:/app/data ghcr.io/pasta-devs/marinara-engine:latest
```

> **Note:** `podman compose` requires the [`podman-compose`](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose/) plugin. On most distributions you can install it with `sudo dnf install podman-compose` (Fedora), `sudo apt install podman-compose` (Debian/Ubuntu), or `pip install podman-compose`.

### Updating

Git-based installs update automatically. If you launch Marinara Engine via `start.sh`, `start.bat`, or `start-termux.sh` from a git checkout, the launcher:

1. Pulls the latest code from GitHub with `git pull`
2. Detects whether the checkout changed
3. Reinstalls dependencies and rebuilds when needed
4. Starts the app on the current version

This includes installs created by the Windows installer, because the installer clones the repository and keeps the `.git` directory.

In-app update checks use the newest GitHub `v*` tag and matching release metadata when available. If you use Docker, the app shows the pull command instead of updating automatically. Docker images are published from `v*` tags.

#### In-App Update Check

Go to **Settings → Advanced → Updates** and click **Check for Updates**. If a new version is available:

- **Git installs** — Click **Apply Update** to pull, rebuild, and restart the server automatically.
- **Docker** — The UI shows the command to run: `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`.

#### Manual Update

If you use a git checkout without the shell launchers or the in-app updater:

```bash
git fetch origin main
git merge --ff-only origin/main
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm db:push
```

Then restart the server.

## Accessing from Mobile (or Another Device)

If you're running Marinara Engine on your computer and want to use it from your phone or tablet on the same network:

If you started the app with bare `pnpm start`, set `HOST=0.0.0.0` first or use one of the shell launchers, which already default to that host.

1. **Find your computer's local IP address:**
   - **Windows:** Run `ipconfig` and look for `IPv4 Address`
   - **macOS:** Check System Settings → Wi-Fi → your network, or run `ipconfig getifaddr en0`
   - **Linux:** Run `hostname -I` or `ip addr`
2. **Open a browser on your phone** and go to:

   ```
   http://<your-computer-ip>:7860
   ```

   Example: `http://192.168.1.42:7860`

3. **Install the PWA** from your browser for a more native app experience.

> **Tip:** If you're not on the same network, tools like [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) give each device a stable IP address on a private network.

## Troubleshooting

### Windows: `EPERM: operation not permitted` when installing pnpm

If you see an error like `EPERM: operation not permitted, open 'C:\Program Files\nodejs\yarnpkg'` or a corepack signature verification failure, corepack could not write to `C:\Program Files\nodejs\`.

**Fix one of these:**

1. **Run as Administrator** — Right-click your terminal (CMD or PowerShell), select "Run as administrator", then run `start.bat` again.
2. **Install pnpm manually** — Run `npm install -g pnpm`, then run `start.bat` again.
3. **Update corepack** — Run `npm install -g corepack`, `corepack enable`, and `corepack prepare pnpm@10.30.3 --activate` in an Administrator terminal.

### Data Seems Missing After A Recent Update

If your chats or presets appear to be missing after updating, do not delete any data folders yet. Recent path changes can make the app open a different SQLite file without erasing the old one.

Check both local data locations:

1. `packages/server/data/`
2. `data/`

Look for `marinara-engine.db` plus any `-wal` and `-shm` companion files. The server now logs the resolved `DATA_DIR` and database path on startup to help identify which one is active.
