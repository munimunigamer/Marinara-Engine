# Changelog

This file is the release-notes source of truth for Marinara Engine. Reuse these entries when publishing GitHub Releases for tags in the `vX.Y.Z` format.

## [1.5.1]

### Changed

- Removed the Quests tab from Game Mode. Game sessions deliberately do not use tracker agents for quests, so the journal now focuses on the code-driven data it actually maintains to avoid excessive generations.

### Fixed

- Returning to an active game session no longer reopens the full-screen world overview and blocks the current scene behind the black intro overlay.
- Combat encounters now wait until narration and scene presentation finish before opening, and HUD widgets hide during combat and restore correctly afterward.
- Loot drops now resolve to the correct item names instead of malformed combat-drop payloads.
- Constant lorebook entries selected for Game Mode are now injected during world generation instead of being skipped during setup.
- Non-English setup languages now propagate through setup generation and GM output formatting, so game text stays in the selected language.
- `/game/setup` now streams upstream tokens during first-turn world generation, reducing timeout failures on slower local backends.
- Map discoveries and NPC meetings now populate the journal from code-owned game state. Locations appear when discovered, and NPCs are logged when first met instead of only after a reputation change.
- Our built-in Gemma-4 will now target available GPUs during generations.
- Fixed Gemma-4 issues on Windows.

## [1.5.0]

### Added

- Introducing the new **Game Mode**! A cross between a classic roleplay and a visual novel, fully driven by the AI GM! Embark on adventures either solo or with a party of characters of your choice. Or perhaps have one of your characters DM the game for you and others? The games span multiple sessions, and _anything_ can happen. The sky is the limit. Well, I guess your wallet, too.
  - Follow an easy and quick game setup wizard to customize your game, or ask the model to come up with the ideas for you.
  - The game's UI is a cross between RPGs (think Baldur's Gate) and visual novels. Witness dynamically changing dialogues, backgrounds, sprites, ambiance, music, sounds, and weather; all based on your current scene. The mode supports sprites and will show them with different expressions. You have an item inventory, an automatically updated journal storing information about your adventure, and an option to talk to your party whenever you feel like simply chatting with them instead of progressing.
  - Your party, and you, all have unique character cards, secrets, and goals to achieve. Remember to keep morale high.
  - Do dice rolls yourself or let the GM handle those for you.
  - Play with the interactive widgets, travel to different locations via a map, build a reputation with NPCs and factions, and explore a dynamically changing world.
  - Everything is handled on the backend. You just sit back, relax, and enjoy the experience.
  - Seriously, just try it. It's fun. I put a lot of time and effort into it, so you'd better enjoy it, or I'll explode.
- Automated sprite generation for expressions and full-body poses in character cards. These can be used for both roleplay and game modes.
- Saved presets for starting new roleplays and conversations.
- Option to save parameters (samplers) per connection.
- Select, duplicate, and manage multiple chats/characters/lorebooks/personas/etc. at once.
- More filters to sort by in lorebooks, and added an ability to lock entries from being edited by agents.
- You may now generate images based on the chat anytime by pressing the "Illustrate" button in the Gallery.
- Spellbooks were added as a separate lorebook category, used in combat.
- Added an ability to download and use Gemma-4-E2B, a tiny model that can be run even on mobile devices and can handle trackers in roleplays and scene analysis for the game mode.
- Other minor things I probably forgot about, have fun discovering them on your own.

### Fixed

- Expression Engine fix that prevented sprites from being generated.
- Messages will no longer disappear and reappear only upon page refresh.
- Scenes created out of conversations now inherit all the parameters from their original chat.
- Fixed a "niche advanced parameter bug", if you know, you know.
- Added full markdown support for roleplays.
- Various Termux/iPhone native fixes for both installation and UI.
- Text formatting with asterisks is now fixed.
- Bettered image generation support.
- Lorebook entries not working in scenes.
- Numbered lists now display correctly.
- You can now select a folder where your backup will be saved.
- No more random scroll-ups when editing lorebooks.
- Additional minor fixes that I can't be bothered enough to list, I want a break.

## [1.4.8]

### Added

- Added `pnpm check`, version-sync helpers, and PR CI checks for version drift.
- Added tracked-installer and release-note scripts plus a GitHub release workflow driven by `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Changed

- Startup config now resolves `.env` before env-sensitive server modules, normalizes repo-root data and SQLite paths, and keeps `/api/*` 404s JSON-only.
- Shell launchers now align on the resolved `PORT`, honor launcher-level browser auto-open consistently, and pin pnpm to the repo version.
- Android now uses a build-time WebView server URL constant instead of a hardcoded Java literal, with optional `MARINARA_PORT` support in `android/build-apk.sh`.
- The client app shell now lazy-loads editors, right-panel surfaces, onboarding, modals, and the main chat surface to reduce initial bundle weight.

### Fixed

- **Vanishing messages after generation** — Messages could disappear at the end of streaming in Roleplay mode due to the browser and service worker serving stale cached API responses. Added triple-layer cache busting (server `Cache-Control: no-store`, client `cache: "no-store"`, and Workbox `NetworkOnly` for API routes) and hardened the streaming-to-message transition with retry-on-failure and double-rAF React commit timing.
- **Agent deletion foreign key constraint** — Deleting an agent no longer fails when chat history references its characters.
- **Mode switch caching** — Switching between Conversation and Roleplay mode now correctly invalidates the cached chat data.
- **Update system** — The in-app update check and notification flow now works reliably.
- `CORS_ORIGINS=*` now behaves as explicit allow-all without credentials, while explicit origin lists retain credentialed CORS support.
- GIF search no longer falls back to a shared embedded API key when `GIPHY_API_KEY` is unset.
- Sidebar tab text metrics were made explicit so descenders like the `y` in `Roleplay` no longer clip.
- Default log level changed to `warn` to reduce console noise.
- Cross-post redirect handling corrected.
- Restored local data-path compatibility so existing installs continue to resolve storage under `packages/server/data`.
- Update checks now resolve the newest GitHub `v*` tag even when `releases/latest` is stale.

## [1.4.7]

### Added

- **Persona Groups** — Organize personas into named groups with full CRUD backend and SQLite storage.
- **Group Scenario Override** — Replace individual character scenarios with a single shared scenario for group chats.
- **AI Persona Maker** — Generate complete personas from a prompt using your LLM connection via SSE streaming.
- **Import Persona** — Import personas from PNG character cards or JSON files.
- **Quick Connection & Persona Switchers** — Floating popover switchers anchored to the chat input.
- **Notification Bubbles** — Floating avatar notification bubbles for unread messages in background chats.

### Changed

- **Personas Panel Redesign** — Search, sort, active/inactive filter, plus New, Import, and AI Maker action buttons.
- **Quick Switcher Vertical Alignment** — Desktop quick switchers anchor to the input box container's top border.
- **Conversation Edit Simplification** — Removed keyboard shortcuts from message editing; explicit cancel/save buttons only.
- **Blank Line Collapsing** — Runs of 3+ consecutive newlines collapsed to a double newline.
- **OpenRouter Thinking/Content Block Parsing** — Correctly parses thinking and content blocks from reasoning models.
- **Claude 4.5/4.6 Temperature-Only Sampling** — Omits `top_p` for Claude models that only support temperature.

### Fixed

- Fixed quick switcher flash at (0,0) on mount.
- Fixed notification bubbles not triggering from normal generation path.
- Fixed notification character ID parsing (JSON string now properly parsed).
- Fixed empty conversation response guard.
- Fixed memory recall scoping.
- Fixed Lorebook Keeper scoping.
- Fixed missing `persona_groups` DB migration.

## [1.4.6]

### Added

- **Bot Browser** — Browse, search, and one-click import characters from Chub.ai directly inside the app. Includes paginated grid view, sort by downloads, stars, or trending, an NSFW filter toggle, and full character detail previews.
- **Chat Folders** — Organize chats into named, color-coded folders with drag-and-drop reorder. Move chats between folders, collapse or expand them, and filter by mode. State is persisted server-side.
- **Slash Commands** — Added SillyTavern-style commands with autocomplete, including `/roll`, `/sys`, `/narrator`, `/continue`, `/as <character>`, `/impersonate`, `/remind <time> <message>`, `/random`, `/scene`, and `/help`.
- **AI Lorebook Maker** — Generate structured lorebook entries from a topic prompt using your LLM connection, with SSE streaming, batch support, and attach-to-existing-lorebook support.
- **Connection Duplicate & Test** — Clone existing connections, including encrypted API keys, and test connectivity with provider-specific checks.
- **ComfyUI Custom Workflows** — Paste custom workflow JSON with `%prompt%`, `%negative_prompt%`, `%width%`, `%height%`, `%seed%`, and `%model%` placeholders.
- **OpenRouter Provider Preference** — Select a preferred upstream provider when routing through OpenRouter.
- **Expanded Image Generation** — Added Pollinations, Stability AI, Together AI, NovelAI, ComfyUI, and AUTOMATIC1111 / SD Web UI alongside OpenAI-compatible image generation.
- **Plain Text Chat Export** — Export chat history as readable plain text alongside the existing JSONL format.
- **Embedding Base URL** — Configure a per-connection base URL for embedding endpoints.

### Changed

- **Performance — Streaming Re-render Optimization** — Extracted streaming UI into isolated components so the main chat area no longer re-renders on every streamed token.
- **Performance — Zustand Selector Batching** — Combined UI store selectors with shallow comparison and memoized style objects to reduce unnecessary re-renders.
- **Performance — Debounced UI Persistence** — Debounced `localStorage` writes and added unload or visibility flushes to reduce churn without losing data.
- **Chat Text Appearance** — Unified chat text color under a single setting and set the default text stroke width to `0.5px`.
- **Folder UX** — New folders now appear at the top, render above unfiled chats, and support inline rename plus hover-delete affordances.
- **Roleplay Input Responsiveness** — Tightened responsive spacing and flex behavior in the input bar to prevent overflow.
- **Home Page Mobile Layout** — Reduced mobile padding, constrained content width, and improved QuickStart card responsiveness.
- **Tracker Injection Order** — Tracker data now injects before Output Format for correct prompt ordering.
- **Settings Panel Polish** — Renamed reset actions to "Reset to default", removed redundant labels, and consolidated reset behavior.

### Fixed

- **Infinite re-render loop** — Wrapped the combined Zustand selector in `useShallow()` so `memo()` can short-circuit correctly.
- **Message background opacity** — Corrected roleplay bubble colors to match the intended Tailwind neutral palette.
- **New folders appearing at the bottom** — Fixed both the server-side sort order assignment and the client-side render ordering.
- **Missing DB column migrations** — Added `openrouter_provider`, `comfyui_workflow`, and `embedding_base_url` to startup column migrations.
- **Combat encounter `parseJSON`** — Corrected escape-sequence handling and added multi-stage sanitization for AI responses.
- **Additional fixes and polish** — Includes smaller bug fixes that shipped as part of the same release.
